# Comprehensive Handoff Document

## Project Overview
This project is built using FastAPI, httpx, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL, and Python 3.12.3. It aims to provide an AI-powered betting system that leverages real-time data and machine learning algorithms to optimize betting decisions.

## Architecture
The architecture of the project includes the following files:
1. **main.py** - The entry point of the application, setting up FastAPI and defining routes.
2. **live_data_router.py** - Manages the retrieval and routing of live data feeds.
3. **jarvis_savant_engine.py** - Implements the core AI engine for decision-making.
4. **context_layer.py** - Handles context-aware processing of betting signals.
5. **lstm_brain.py** - Contains the LSTM model architecture for predictions.
6. **esoteric_engine.py** - Integrates esoteric methods for enhancing decision-making.
7. **auto_grader.py** - Implements automatic grading of bet outcomes.
8. **database.py** - Handles all interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
... (plus 30 more files with respective descriptions)

## API Endpoints
Here is a list of all live API endpoints with descriptions:
- **GET /api/live-data** - Fetches the latest live data from multiple sources.
- **POST /api/bet** - Places a new bet based on the user’s selections. 
... (full list with endpoint descriptions)

## JARVIS Savant Engine
### THE IMMORTAL 2178 Proof
This segment explores the mathematical proof for the equation 2178×4=8712, underpinning the framework for predictive analytics used in this system.

### JARVIS Triggers
Here is a table describing the JARVIS triggers and their boosts:
| Number | Trigger | Boost |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 2178   | ...     | ...   |
| 201    | ...     | ...   |
... (including all 8 triggers)

### Gematria System
The gematria system includes an explanation of Simple Reverse Jewish calculations to derive meaningful insights.

## Phase 1: Confluence Core
This section details various scales and calculations used in the system:
- Public fade signal graduated scale: 80% -0.95, 75% -0.85, 70% -0.75
- Mid-spread Goldilocks zone: 4-9 points +20% boost
- Large spread trap: ≥14 points -20% penalty
- Confluence calculation formula: alignment = 1 - |research - esoteric| / 10
- Levels: IMMORTAL +10, JARVIS_PERFECT +7, etc.
